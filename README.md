## Introduction

GoalsTracker is a goal-setting web application built with Django. It provides users with a minimal and focused interface to define, manage, and complete their personal goals. Unlike full-featured productivity apps, GoalsTracker embraces simplicity â€” prioritizing essential functionality with a clean Bootstrap-based design and intuitive flow.

---

## UX Design

This application follows a clean and minimal UX approach:

- **Interface**: Bootstrap is used for layout and responsiveness.
- **Typography**: Default Bootstrap typography ensures consistency and simplicity.
- **Focus**: UX is intentionally kept minimal to draw user attention toward completing tasks rather than navigating features.

---

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to sign up and log in, so that I can manage my own goals.
- As a user, I want to create, edit, and delete goals, so that I can track my progress.
- As a user, I want to mark a goal as completed, so that I can feel progress and stay motivated.
- As a user, I want to set a due date or deadline for each goal, so that I stay accountable.
- As a user I want to be able to reset my password in case I forget it.
- As a user I want to be able to set priority for my goals, so I can prioritize better.
